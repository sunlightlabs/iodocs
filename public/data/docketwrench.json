The result of this process is a so-called dendrogram\nin which clusters can be examined in a tree with smaller numbers of loose clusters at the top, dividing into larger numbers of tigher clusters towards the bottom.\nDocket Wrench includes cluster groups at the 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% similarity levels.</p>\n<p>This endpoint returns the cluster tree for a given docket.  It includes some general information about the docket's clustering behavior in the <em>stats</em> object (its agency, and how many documents\nwere or were not included in the clustering response, for example).  The actual cluster tree is in <em>cluster_hierarchy</em>, which is a list of the loosest clusters in the docket. Each cluster\nis uniquely identified by a combination of the similarity threshold (the <em>cutoff</em> key), and the numerical ID of a canonical document it contains (the <em>name</em> key).  Thus, each cluster has a <em>cutoff</em>,\n<em>name</em>, <em>size</em> (which is the number of documents it contains), <em>phrases</em>, and <em>children</em>.  <em>children</em> is another list, of the clusters that result from the splitting of that cluster into subclusters as the\nsimilarity threshold is increased, so each will have a higher similarity threshold than its parent.  A cluster won't have children if it's already at the highest threshold (90%), or if no two documents\nit contains are sufficiently similar to still form a cluster at the next threshold of similarity.</p>\n<p>This endpoint can also supply distinguishing phrases for each cluster.  The process of calculating these phrases is computationally expensive, so by default, phrases are only included if they've already\nbeen generated and cached; each cluster's <em>phrases</em> key will be a list of strings if this is true, or null otherwise.  Setting the <em>require_summaries</em> GET parameter to <em>True</em> will force computation of phrases\nif they haven't already been generated.  Docket Wrench's usage pattern is to make an initial call to this endpoint without <em>require_summaries</em>, then make a second call with <em>require_summaries</em> if phrases weren't\nincluded in the initial response.  This allows the application to render other parts of the clustering visualization without waiting for phrases to be computed, which is slower than the initial clustering\ncalculations.  Other consuming applications may want to follow this same pattern.</p>"}, {"MethodName": "Single-cluster Document List", "parameters": [{"Default": "", "Required": "Y", "Type": "string", "Name": "docket_id", "Description": ""}, {"Default": "", "Required": "Y", "Type": "string", "Name": "cluster_id", "Description": ""}, {"Default": "", "Required": "N", "Type": "string", "Name": "cutoff", "Description": "The cutoff for the docket, specified as a number between 0.5 and 0.9, inclusive."}], "RequiresOAuth": "N", "URI": "/docket/:docket_id/cluster/:cluster_id", "HTTPMethod": "GET", "Synopsis": "<p>This endpoint supplies a list of the documents within a given cluster; it's used to fill the bottom left pane of the Docket Wrench\nclustering visualization.
